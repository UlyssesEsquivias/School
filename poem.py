print('''When day comes, we ask ourselves, where can we find light in this never-ending shade?

The loss we carry. A sea we must wade.
We braved the belly of the beast.

We've learned that quiet isn't always peace, 
and the norms and notions of what "just" is isn't always justice.

And yet the dawn is ours before we knew it.

Somehow we do it.''')
